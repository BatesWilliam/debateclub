# Amarillo ISD Debate Clubs

I got the bracket working and set up both a Mongo connection and a connection to the Google Calendar API.
In order to prove I can use the Google Calendar API, as I was unable to pull it on a page, 
can be demonstrated in the following steps.

1. Change directory to '~/workspace/DebateClubFINAL'
2. Enter the command 'node quickstart.js'

This will pull the items from the calendar data I have uploaded from my connected calendar.
